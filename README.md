# üí´ About Me:
I am a dedicated Third-year Software Engineering undergraduate at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT), passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges. My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in programming, web development, mobile application development, DevOps principles, and software engineering methodologies.

I have hands-on experience with various projects, including developing a user management system using the MERN stack, creating the "Wash and Go" vehicle wash service website, and designing a personalized fitness application with integrated task management. Additionally, I developed "Aroma," a coffee shop application using Android Studio, which features a customizable menu, event management, and personalized user experiences. 

My technical skills include proficiency in programming languages like Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP, and R, alongside modern web development frameworks such as ReactJS and Tailwind CSS. I am also experienced in database management systems like MySQL, MongoDB, and SQLite.

As a DevOps enthusiast, I am proficient in version control systems like Git and platforms such as GitHub. I have practical knowledge of containerization tools like Docker, CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions, and cloud computing with AWS technologies. My familiarity with AWS includes services like EC2 for hosting, S3 for scalable storage

Beyond my technical expertise, I possess strong project management, teamwork, leadership, and communication skills. My collaborative experiences with academic projects have further strengthened my ability to work effectively in dynamic environments. I am fluent in both English and Sinhala.

I am committed to continuous learning and professional growth. My goal is to contribute to innovative software solutions and DevOps-driven projects, ensuring efficient, reliable, and scalable systems in collaborative settings.
